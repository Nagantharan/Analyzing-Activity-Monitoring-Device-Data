Created a plot to compare and contrast number of steps between the week and weekend. There is a higher peak earlier on weekdays, and more overall activity on weekends.

weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
              "Friday")
new_activity$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(new_activity$date)),weekdays), "Weekday", "Weekend"))
StepsTotalUnion <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, new_activity, mean)
library(lattice)
xyplot(StepsTotalUnion$steps ~ StepsTotalUnion$interval|StepsTotalUnion$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")
